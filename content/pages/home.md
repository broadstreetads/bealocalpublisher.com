### How to Get A Blog <a id="get-a-blog"></a>

You have a lot of choices when it comes to hosting a news blog, but it's important that you make the *right* choice. The type of software you'll need is called a *Content Management System* (CMS). This is software that is installed to a web server. The most popular free choices for local blogs are:

* Wordpress
* Drupal
* Joomla
* Typepad

Of the four above, Wordpress is the recommended choice for the following reasons:

* It's the best supported by the developer community
* It has the most themes/designs
* You will be able to find developers easier if you should need one
* More plugins (functionality extensions) are available
* The most famous hyperlocals use it
* More web hosts support it
* It is the most flexible

It is possible to get started using a free account using a service like Tumblr and Blogger, but you'll find that the ability to customize your blog and grow a business will become a challenge down the road. Unless you have tightly-held convictions, go with Wordpress.

The one definite cost you will incur is for a web host. Web host costs can range from as little as $8 per month to $100/month. The makers of Wordpress list a [variety of hosts](http://wordpress.org/hosting/), but this guide **strongly recommends [WPEngine](http://wpengine.com)** for the following reasons:

* WPEngine specializes in Wordpress
* Wordpress installation is done for you
* Their team is dedicated to keeping their platform fast
* They achieve page load times much faster than the average Wordpress install
* Backups and safety precautions are taken care of for you

You can get started with WPEngine at $29/month. It's a little more expensive than other hosting options, but the ease of use and reliability is well worth it in our opinion.

**Disclosure:** We have no affiliation with WPEngine or Wordpress. We just like them.

**Action Items**

* Decide on a platform (*recommended*: Wordpress)
* Get hosting (*recommended*: WPEngine)

Once you've found hosting, ask your webhost support team how to set up Wordpress. *Most web hosts can easily install it for you.* If you chose WPEngine, it will already be installed for you.
