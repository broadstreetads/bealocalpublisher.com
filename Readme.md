Be a Local Publisher is a one-page instruction manual explaining how a non-technical writer might get set up with their own local news blog.

There are hurdles like setting up a CMS, adserver, and other issues that we want to help journalists tackle.

It's alive at [BeALocalPublisher.com](http://bealocalpublisher.com).

## Running locally
